		<p>WHOIS ("Who is?") Is a protocol through which you can get information
			about a domain name or an IP address.</p>

		<p>With the help of WHOIS you can find out if the domain is busy, as well as find out contact
			details of the domain owner, creation date, expiration date of registration and much more.</p>

		<p>All this information is public, but some registrars allow you to hide direct contacts of the
			domain owner. In this case, contacts of the registrar company will be indicated.</p>
